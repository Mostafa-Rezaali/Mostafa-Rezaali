## About

I am a doctoral researcher specializing in climate and earth system sciences at the University of Florida's Department of Geography. My research bridges climate science, earth system modeling, and artificial intelligence to advance our understanding of extreme weather events and climate variability. I focus on developing data-driven approaches to detect, characterize, and predict heat waves and other climate extremes within the broader context of earth system dynamics.

My work integrates observations from multiple earth system components—atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and cryosphere—with machine learning techniques to improve extreme weather forecasting and enhance climate adaptation strategies. I am particularly interested in understanding the physical mechanisms driving climate extremes and leveraging both process-based models and AI to advance predictive capabilities.
