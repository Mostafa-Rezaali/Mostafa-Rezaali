## About

I am a doctoral researcher in the Department of Geography at the University of Florida, specializing in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning to climate science. My research focuses on understanding, detecting, and predicting heat waves and extreme weather events through the integration of numerical climate models with advanced computational techniques.

My work addresses critical challenges in climate science by developing data-driven approaches that enhance our capacity to forecast extreme weather events and support climate adaptation strategies. I am particularly interested in coupling traditional climate modeling frameworks with machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and advance our understanding of climate extremes.
